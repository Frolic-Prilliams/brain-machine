# brain-machine
Custom programs based on Mitch Altman's Brain Machine from Make Magazine #10.

The files contained in this repo are based on Mitch Altman's Brain Machine which was originally featured in Make Magazine #10. The original project hacks a MiniPOV3 kit from Adafruit (https://learn.adafruit.com/minipov3) and rewrites the firmware to create a Sound and Light Machine (SLM) that entrains the brain to specific frequencies using syncronized binaural beats and flashing lights.

The most recent firmware from Mitch Altman (http://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php) uses a base frequency of 200Hz for the binaural beats, defines a single frequency for each brainwave frequency and provides a simple stepped 14 minute meditation program. I've modified the firmware to create a number of variants for specific meditation goals.

Please feel free to use these in your own brain machine or as the foundation for your own custom sequences. :)

If you get some use out of these and would like to send me a tip, feel free to send me some XEM:
